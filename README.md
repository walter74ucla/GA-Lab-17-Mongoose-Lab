# Mongoose Lab

Create a simple terminal app that does the following.  There is no express, so the app should run once, perform the actions described, in the order in which they're described, and then exit.

1. Create a schema for a Company
    - name (string, required)
    - founded (Date)
    - employees (Number)
    - active (Boolean)
    - products (array of Strings)
    - CEO (object with below properties)
        - name (String)
        - age (Number)
1. Create Apple
    - name: Apple
    - founded: April 1, 1976
    - employees: 2
    - active: false
    - products: ['computers']
    - CEO:
        - name: Steve Jobs
        - age: 21
1. Create Google
    - name: Google
    - founded: September 4, 1998
    - employees: 57,100
    - active: true
    - products: ['search','maps','email']
    - CEO:
        - name: Larry Page
        - age: 43
1. Update Apple
    - name: Apple Inc
    - founded: April 1, 1976
    - employees: 66,000
    - active: true
    - products: ['computers', 'phones', 'tablets']
    - CEO:
        - name: Time Cook
        - age: 56
1. Find Apple
    - log its employees
1. Find Google
    - log its employees
1. Delete Apple
1. Delete Google

If you included console.logs, you may have noticed that things aren't happening in the same order that you thought they would.  This is because database access is an asynchronous operation.  Where do you put code that you want to execute _after_ you've done your database read/write?  Write the previous exercise so that creating/updating/finding/deleting apple happens "at the same time" as creating/updating/finding/deleting google.  If you want one database operation to happen after another one, you'll have to start it inside the callback that happens after the first one is done. This is because of Node's asynchronous nature!

## Hungry for More?

Integrate this into an express app. Have each step be its own page with a link to the next step (which is also a page).
